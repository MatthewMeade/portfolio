Docker config for my home server.

The primary use for the server is as a NAS with a public share. The data is made accessable on my local network with samba or from outside my network with [filebrowser](https://hub.docker.com/r/hurlenko/filebrowser). Anything in the /\`public\` folder is served over https at https://home.matthewmeade.ca/public .

FileBrowser also allows me to share any file in the NAS, optionally with an expiring link or a password.

Since I don't have a static IP at home, I use [cloudflare-ddns](https://hub.docker.com/r/joshava/cloudflare-ddns) to keep the DNS records pointed at my house up to date.
